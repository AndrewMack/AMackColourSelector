AMackColourSelector is going to be an easy-to-use and easy-to-implement colour selector.

AMackColourSelector is built using WPF and C# and requires .NET version 4.0+ to be installed. Eventually I would love to replicate in C++ but for now, this requirement will remain.

Supports custom colours and a quick-select window (single-click to select your custom colours).
